# Penguins Logistic Regression

This project aims to analyze the Palmer Penguins dataset and perform various data analysis tasks such as clustering, outlier detection, and logistic regression analysis. The dataset contains data about penguins from three species (“Adelie”, “Chinstrap”, and “Gentoo”) and includes measurements such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and other attributes.

A range of tasks are performed including clustering, outlier detection, and logistic regression to understand the relationship between penguin characteristics and their sex. The three clusters aligned well with the three species (Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo), and each of these species showed distinct characteristics. The analysis showed that the features of body mass and bill depth were particularly useful in determining these groups.

Logistic regression was applied to predict the sex of penguins based on their physical features. The results showed that bill length, bill depth, and body mass were significant predictors of sex, where the model even achieved a high accuracy of 90.63% when all predictors were included. When models with fewer predictors were used the accuracy, decreased supporting the importance of including the right features. The model also effectively predicted the sex of new observations. 

Overall, this analysis provided valuable insights into the physical characteristics of penguins, highlighting how specific measurements can be used to predict the sex of penguins with a high degree of accuracy. The findings from the clustering and regression models reinforce the importance of using multiple features to achieve reliable classification in biological datasets.
